# JavaScript-Flask-Simple-Web-App
> Just for fun

This is a simple web app utilising an API I wrote in python using the Flask framework.

It uses the open endpoints made available by the api to fetch famous programmers data stored. 

Basically I just wanted to make a web app that uses both python,javascript and html functionalities.
